Slides from the FOSDEM 2019 talk: When perf-html met a11y

One in seven people is disabled. 

And accessible websites (and apps!) enable them to work on an even playing field, while also being more usable for everyone. 

For the past couple of months, I've been working on improving the accessibility of perf-html, Mozilla's virtuoso profiler. 

During this talk, I'll be sharing my journey into the world of accessibility and demonstrating how perf-html aims to make Mozilla not just more performant, but also more usable for everyone.  

Topics covered: Focus, keyboard navigation, semantic HTML, ARIA and Accessibility inspector <3
